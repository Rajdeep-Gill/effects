# CSS/HTML/JS Effects Repository

This repository contains various CSS, HTML, and JavaScript effects that you can use in your web projects.
I have created this to learn more and play around with CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

Feel free to explore the repository and try out different effects in your projects.

## Usage

To use any of the effects in your project, simply copy the relevant CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code and integrate it into your web page. Each effect will have its own set of instructions and code snippets in its respective folder.
